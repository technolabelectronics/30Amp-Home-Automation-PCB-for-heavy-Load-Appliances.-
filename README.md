# Introduction.

I have also designed lot other home-automation PCBs..like ..2 node , 4 node and 8 node home-automation PCBs.
These pcbs are fully tested and works very well These PCBs are best for home-automation system.
But these pcbs could handle only upto 10 amp load, so we can  only use this pcbs for small load appliances like light bulb, televisions which consume less power, but if we want to automate heavy load appliances like air conditioners, washing machines, geyser then in that case.
We couldn't connect to these PCBs , these pcbs will not handle such heavy load and eventually the relay will burn out.

So to solve this problem, I have design brand new home-automation pcb which can easily handle upto 30amp load.
And most of the heavy load appliances that we used in our homes consumes current under 30 amp, So this pcb is perfect for those appliances 
So in this way we can connect any heavy load appliances.

This PCB is compatible   with all the popular IOT platform like blynk , esp rainmaker. In this way we can easily integrate this pcb with Alexa and google assistant.
And apart from this , we can also give manual input to this pcb and also we can connect via Bluetooth to control the appliances from smartphone application in local area network.

And the size of this PCB is very small..and  can easily fits inside the electrical switch board.

And there is two onboards LEDs , which we can use in many ways ...like for testing code, wifi indicator.
